# Frontend Quiz

We'd like to create a new form to ask some questions to our frontend developers.

- When a user is responding our quiz, we'd like to collect some data about him. The name and email address would be required.
- We would like to have dynamic questions and answers. All answers will be required and the user should be able to select only once per question.
- Build the new fields in the HTML, then write the css and js.
- Add basic validation
- Is there a security flaw?
- Bonus track: Show if the answer is valid or invalid adding some styles after submit.
