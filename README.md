# Frontend Quiz

We'd like to create a new form to ask some questions to our frontend developers. The name and email address would be required. We also want to test their knowledge by asking you a few questions.

1. Complete the form and add basic HTML validations.
2. We would like to have dynamic questions and answers. All answers will be required and the user should be able to select only once per question. Build the new fields using `myQuestions` array.
3. Is there a security flaw?
4. Bonus track: Show if the answer is valid or invalid adding some styles after submit.
